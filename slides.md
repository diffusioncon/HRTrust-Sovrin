## How to do it?

- Send out forms to employees in advance of their first day (as mentioned above).
- Put forms online and automate them as much as possible to reduce time.
- Have a buddy walk new hires through the forms to make completing them easier and more efficient.
- Load forms into a portal that can be accessed at any time so employees can complete them during a quiet period, at home, or throughout the week. That way they won’t have to set aside a large chunk of time in one sitting (refer back to #4 to see how a resource center can help with this).

> The relationship is often less fraught, less hierarchical, and doesn’t
> come with the same expectations.
